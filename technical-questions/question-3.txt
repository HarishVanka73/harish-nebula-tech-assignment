Infrastructure as Code (Terraform at Scale)

I automated AWS infra provisioning using Terraform with modular architecture

Root module for all child modules.

Child modules for VPC, subnets, NAT/IGW, EKS, RDS MySQL, Bastion, ALB, IAM roles.

Remote state in S3 with DynamoDB locking for team collaboration.

Problems Solved:

For consistency same Terraform code used across environments, reducing drift.

For scalability easier to spin up new EKS clusters and existing node groups to scale or RDS instances across AZs.

For speed reduced manual setup time from days to under an hour for a full environment.

Enhancements:

Added lifecycle rules to avoid accidental resource deletions.

Used dynamic blocks for security group rules and node groups.
